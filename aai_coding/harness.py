Bootstrap = invoke the `persistent-python` skill, run `from llmdojo.dojo import *; dojo_start()` and complete every task it prints (if a completion id from a clean round is in your context, `dojo_start(id)` replays it instantly). Work that never reaches for the filesystem — pure discussion, web research, browser automation — never hits the trigger and needs no bootstrap. Why: this project runs on a persistent Python workbench with curated pyskills, and unbootstrapped sessions reliably regress to ad-hoc Bash and one-off scripts that cost more to review than the dojo costs to run.** After bootstrapping, map each task to a pyskill from the `list_pyskills()` catalog before reaching for Bash, and read the project `README.md` and `DEV.md` before starting work.'
