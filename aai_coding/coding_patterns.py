r'''Jeremy's coding style and conventions: read before writing, reviewing, or assessing any code.

# Coding Patterns

Based on the fastai style guide and Jeremy's 3 decades of coding experience, and used across all of his projects, not only fastai ones.

Use the fastcore/fasthtml ecosystem (fastcore, fasthtml, fastlite, ...) when picking libraries. These are Jeremy's own, editable-installed as siblings, and preferred over heavier third-party alternatives.

## Improving Tooling Pays Off Exponentially

Making our tools marvellous matters more than the task in hand. A finished task helps once. A better tool helps every later task, every later session, and the whole team. Ergonomics count as much as capability. Most code you have read was written by people who put up with tool friction rather than fix it, so your default is the workaround. Here the tools are ours and one edit away. When something grates, fix it or raise it. Never quietly work around it.

## Every Construct Must Earn Its Place

Readers assume everything present is necessary. When they see `str(x)` on something that's already a str, they stop and wonder what subtle thing it's guarding against. When the answer is "nothing", they paid for a mystery with no payoff. The same goes for defensive copies (`list(x)` that's never mutated), "just in case" try/excepts, redundant type coercions, and unused parameters. Before adding any construct, know why it's needed. If you can't say, leave it out. The cost doubles in nbdev projects, where tests are documentation.

Knowing why a construct is needed does not mean waiting for someone to ask for it. An open source user who finds a gap concludes the library cannot do it and moves on. Judge a library feature by whether the design calls for it and users would expect it.

The same applies to prose in code: almost never add comments (only when the code is truly unclear), and don't add type hints, docstrings, or boilerplate that pull no weight. Prefer concise, readable code over verbose "enterprise" style.
Only write a code comment to state a constraint the code itself can't show, never to say where it came from, what the next line does, or why your change is correct. That's you talking to the reviewer, not the next reader, and it's noise the moment the PR merges.

## Trust Tool Defaults

All our tooling has carefully chosen defaults. Use them unless an exceptional, task-specific requirement makes the default unsuitable. This applies to CLI flags, Python arguments, and tool-call options. An override must address that requirement—not reflect habit or an assumed improvement over the default.

- Wanting the same flag on every run means it's a missing config line: promote it and go back to the bare command (`pytest --timeout 300` on every run becomes `timeout = 60` under `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`).
- Don't check-then-apply when applying is the goal: `cargo fmt`, not `cargo fmt --check` followed by `cargo fmt`. `--check` is for a final no-mutation verification, e.g. CI.
- Run commands bare and read their output. Never pipe through truncating filters (`| tail -20`, `| grep PASS`): truncation is decided before the output exists, and it hides exactly the surprises worth seeing. Never merge stderr into stdout with `2>&1`: separated, a crash is unmissable.
- On the rare occasion output genuinely can't come back inline (far too large), redirect the streams separately (`>meta/stdout.txt 2>meta/stderr.txt`) and read the files from the kernel.
- A real one-off requirement gets its flag once, with the reason stated alongside, and disappears again on the next call.

## Docments

Docments are trailing comments on function parameters that fastcore uses for documentation. A signature with docments (or any long signature) uses this layout: `(` stays on the def line, each parameter on its own line indented 4, and `):` alone on its own line at def indent:

```python
@delegates(start_kernel)
async def run_kernel(
    kernel_name='python3', # Kernelspec name to launch
    manager_cls=KernelManager, # Manager class, e.g. a subclass customizing launch
    **kwargs
):
```

NEVER remove docments when refactoring. They're essential documentation.

When `**kwargs` passes through to a known callee, decorate with `@delegates(callee)` so the signature shows the real options. delegates REQUIRES the collector to be named `kwargs`, not `kw` etc. Skip the decorator when the callee's own signature is just `**kwargs` (nothing to delegate).

## Raw Strings

Write any non-trivial string literal as a raw string (`r"..."` / `r"""..."""`): regexes, text you pass to tools, code or markup inside strings, anything multi-line or containing backslashes. In plain strings a stray `\n` or `\d` either errors or silently corrupts, and each miss costs a round trip to diagnose plus another to fix. Raw strings are WYSIWYG, so the first attempt matches what you meant. The `r` costs nothing when no escapes are present, so make it the default, not the exception.

## Style Checker (chkstyle)

Run `chkstyle {path}` to check fastai style (only include path if needed). But use judgment. chkstyle is a hint, not gospel.
In nbdev projects, point it at the notebooks (`chkstyle nbs/00_core.ipynb`), not the exported `.py`. The notebook run also checks example and test cells, which never reach the module.

## Config Patterns

Read from standard locations rather than duplicating config:

- GitHub release notes config: `.github/release.yml`
- Project config: `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.yourpkg]`
- Infer values when possible (e.g., package name from `[project].name`)
- Bundle data files inside the package and read them with `importlib.resources`

## Versioning: Bump After Release

Jeremy bumps the version immediately after each release, as part of releasing and never as part of a change. The tree therefore always carries the next release's version. A sibling dep pin can name a version before it ships (`foo>=<foo's local version>`).

A downstream pin is part of the change that creates the dependency. When a change makes one package consume another's new behavior or API, stamp the consumers' pins in the same session. A pin deferred to release time is a forgotten pin.

This convention is for Python projects. Other artifact types version at change time instead: for example, the Claude Code plugins in skill-plugins bump automatically when `./build.py` regenerates a changed output.

## Project Layout

Prefer flat layout over src/:

```
myproject/
├── mypkg/
│   └── __init__.py
├── tests/
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

## Testing

In nbdev projects (most projects here) there are no test cells: tests ARE the documentation, changes revise lesson cells, and the red-green check applies only to an assertion you actually revised or added (see `doc(nbdev.skill)`). Coverage is never a goal.

All code has writing, maintenance, and readability costs, and tests most of all: every test must be kept passing forever, gets read by every future contributor, and must be revised whenever the behavior it pins changes. So never write a test as a reflex. You may ONLY add a test when:

- it documents an idea, or
- the logic is intricate enough that you had to think carefully to get it right (edge cases, parsing, arithmetic, tricky conditionals: the places a future change could silently break it), or
- the code assumes something about an external system (a file format, an API's response shape, another tool's behavior) that is somewhat likely to change one day, and we want to hear about it when the assumption is violated. These must exercise the real thing (a mock merely re-states our assumption), so they're usually the slow-marked tests

Wiring and orchestration get zero tests: re-exports, delegations, one-line glue, functions that only sequence calls to other tools. A test there only asserts that Python works, and pins down internals we may want to change. Strong tell: if a test needs recording fakes or mock collaborators to reach the code, it's testing a transcript of the implementation, not logic. Extract the logic into a small pure function and test that, or don't test at all.

Pytest is for checks that don't fit as a readable notebook lesson and are too complex or distracting even for a `#|hide` cell; there, ALWAYS work red-green: write the test FIRST, run it to see it fail, THEN make the change, then run it again to see it pass.

- Prefer as few tests as possible: a single test that walks through many checks is more readable and faster than many small ones
- A check worth keeping goes in a real test file or notebook cell, never left as an ad-hoc command. In a notebook, the checks made while exploring often ARE the narrative (each one both documents what we needed to know and keeps guarding it), so they stay as example cells. In a pytest file, an exploratory check survives only if it meets one of the criteria above
- Assert the logic, not incidentals: check what the behavior guarantees, never byte-exact renderings, exact reprs, or field order. A test that compares a whole output string locks in formatting decisions that were never the point (e.g. assert the content appears in a markdown display block, not the display's exact text). NEVER use tests to "lock in" behavior, unless that exact behavior really is a key part of the logic or contract that must always be true forever
- Use `pytest -q` (not `python -m pytest`, which prompts for permission). nbdev projects use `nbdev-test` on the changed notebook, but some notebooks are slow or hit live services, so check with the user before running one you don't know is safe (known safe: all of pyskills)
- Don't run slow-marked tests until finishing a session, or after a change likely to directly impact them

## One-liner Patterns

```python
# Conditionals
if not x: return default
if x and y: do_thing()

# Try/except
try: return run("cmd").strip() or default
except Exception: return default

# Loops
for i in range(n): result[i] = 0
while len(items) < 3: items.append(0)
```

## Import Style

Combine imports on single lines:

```python
import os, re, sys, shutil
from pathlib import Path
from fastcore.utils import *
```

`from fastcore.utils import *` already provides `os`, `Path`, and much of the stdlib, so don't re-import those alongside it.
